Explanation:

üîç Program Overview:
Objective: Calculate the sum of an array of integers using multiple processes in parallel.

Library Used: MPJ Express (Java MPI).

Workflow:

The root process initializes a full array (send_buffer).

The array is divided equally among all processes using Scatter.

Each process computes the sum of its chunk.

The intermediate sums are gathered using Gather.

The root process calculates the final sum.

‚úÖ What Works Well:
Proper use of Scatter and Gather MPI functions.

Use of buffers for communication.

Correct calculation of local sums.

Final aggregation only by the root process.

üîÅ Suggested Improvements:
Array Initialization Output:
Instead of printing "Element i = i" you might want to:

java
Copy
Edit
System.out.print("Element " + i + " = ");
send_buffer[i] = scanner.nextInt(); // allow user input (optional)
Loop Start Index:
You're starting from i = 1 when calculating the partial sum:

java
Copy
Edit
for(int i = 1; i < unitsize; i++) {
    recieve_buffer[0] += recieve_buffer[i];
}
This is correct, since you're accumulating into recieve_buffer[0]. Alternatively, to keep things clearer, use a sum variable.

Imports:
Remove the duplicate import mpi.*;.

Spelling: recieve_buffer ‚Üí receive_buffer for clarity and standard spelling.

üß† Concepts Demonstrated:
MPI Scatter: Distributes parts of the array to each process.

MPI Gather: Collects results from each process.

Parallel Computation: Each process works on part of the task independently.

üìå Sample Output (with 4 processes):
python
Copy
Edit
Enter 20 elements
Element 0 = 0
Element 1 = 1
...
Element 19 = 19
Intermediate sum at process 0 is 10
Intermediate sum at process 1 is 35
Intermediate sum at process 2 is 60
Intermediate sum at process 3 is 85
Final sum : 190
